# getting data course project



This is the ReadMe for the course project of "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The data was originally sourced from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones



# description

The script `run_analysis.R` takes the raw data from the data source linked above, and merges all the data together in a tidy, long-format data frame.

As a side note. The way the authors structured the data in that repository was absolutely abysmal. It could have easily been structured into a single table, and made everything a lot less complicated for anyone trying to use their data.
